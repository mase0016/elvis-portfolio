## Overview
This portfolio page showcases “The Awakening” as a digital graphics collection, presenting key visuals and variations in a gallery format. The work shown includes a mix of academic assignments and freelance deliverables, curated together to demonstrate range and consistency.

## Movie Poster
**The Awakening** is an 11×17 sci‑fi/horror movie poster created as an academic assignment, featuring a self-portrait integrated into the key art through compositing and blending techniques. The design uses dramatic lighting, gritty textures, and a bold typographic hierarchy to build tension and guide the viewer from tagline to title. Built in a print-ready workflow (CMYK with bleed), this piece demonstrates both concept development and production-focused execution.

## Animal Avatar
This academic project challenged me to design a scalable animal avatar in vector format across three Apple icon sizes (57px, 144px, 512px), each with a different level of detail. I created a rhino character with a strong silhouette and clear shapes for the small icon, then progressively added color, texture, and gradients for the medium and large versions while keeping the character consistent across sizes. The final deliverables were organized in a clean, layered Illustrator file and exported as optimized RGB assets ready for interface use.

## Image Restoration
**Academic project**: This restoration was completed as part of a class assignment to practice non-destructive retouching, tonal correction, and texture preservation. The original photo was used strictly for learning purposes, and the final output is shown here for portfolio demonstration.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Mixing raster and vector elements without quality loss.<br/>
**Solution**: Keeped logos/shapes in Illustrator (vector) and only rasterize when exporting finals; composite/polish in Photoshop.
- **Challenge**: Presenting many deliverables cleanly in a portfolio format.<br/>
**Solution**: Used a simple gallery structure and export consistent image sizes so the work stays scannable while scrolling.
- **Challenge**: Maintaining consistency across many images/Designs in one long page.<br/>
**Solution**: Used consistent image sizing and spacing so viewers can scan the work quickly.
- **Challenge**: Keeping Algonquin College’s branding consistent across different materials (print and digital) was difficult without clear, shared rules.<br/>
**Solution**: I created a brand guide that defines the logo usage, color palette, typography hierarchy, and icon style so everything looks unified and professional across all touchpoints.
