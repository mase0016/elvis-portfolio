## Design process

- **Plan store structure**: Define primary navigation (Home/About/Blog/Catalog/Contact) so visitors can shop and also learn about the brand.
- **Build the catalog**: Create products for stickers and miniature figures, organize them into collections, and enable filters for browsing.
- **Create promotional strategy**: Add sale pricing, a countdown timer, and a free-shipping message to support conversions and campaign-style drops.
- **Add trust + support**: Publish About content for brand story and provide a complete Contact page with clear support expectations.
- **Test and refine**: Check that key actions (browse items, open product options, find policies/contact) are visible and consistent across pages.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Product browsing can feel overwhelming with multiple items and categories.<br/>
  **Solution**: Used collection filters (availability, price) and keep product cards consistent with clear pricing and sale badges.
- **Challenge**: Shoppers may hesitate due to shipping cost uncertainty.<br/>
  **Solution**: Placed a free-shipping threshold message in the top bar so it’s visible early in the shopping journey.
- **Challenge**: Promotions need to feel time-sensitive without cluttering the UI.<br/>
  **Solution**: Used a single countdown timer in the header area so urgency is communicated consistently across pages.
