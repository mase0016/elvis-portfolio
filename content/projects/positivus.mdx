## Project Overview

The Active Life Centre is a new community hub in Ottawa designed to serve people of all ages from toddlers to seniors with inclusive recreational programming. The centre features a pool, ice rink, steam rooms, gym, and fitness classes tailored for different skill levels. A key project goal is to design a welcoming and accessible website that reflects the community spirit of the centre and makes it easy for visitors to:

- Explore facilities
- View and register for programs (e.g., swim classes, fitness sessions, drop-in sports)
- Sign up for summer programming for children
- Find upcoming events and contact the centre easily

This project follows the Design Thinking process to deliver a website rooted in real user needs, backed by persona development and research insights. The end product will contribute to a professional UX case study that demonstrates web design skills and a user-centered approach.

## Key features and benefits

- **Facility discovery (Pool, ice rink, gym, steam rooms, classes)**: Clear facility pages help visitors quickly understand what’s available and what to bring (e.g., swim gear, skates), reducing confusion and phone calls.
- **Programs hub with filters**: Age/skill-level filters (toddlers, kids, teens, adults, seniors; beginner–advanced) make it faster for families and new users to find the right class.
- **Simple registration flow**: A step-by-step “select program → choose time → register → confirmation” flow builds confidence for all users and reduces drop-offs.
- **Family-friendly booking**: “Add another child” / “Register household” enables multi-child registration in one checkout, addressing a major family pain point.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO
- **CSS3**: Custom styling for branding, spacing, and responsive tweaks beyond the framework defaults
- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive behaviors (e.g., navigation, small UI interactions, form behavior depending on your implementation)
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive grid system and prebuilt components (navbars, cards, buttons, forms) to speed up development and keep UI consistent across screen sizes
- **Figma**: For design prototyping and collaboration
- **Git + GitHub Pages**: Version control and static hosting for deployment

## Key Sections

1. **Hero section**: Strong headline (community + inclusivity), short supporting line, and primary CTA buttons eg “View Programs” and “Register Now.”
2. **Quick-access tiles**: Fast links to Pool, Ice Rink, Fitness Classes, and Membership/Drop-in.
3. **Programs & registration**: Search + filters (programs, age, categories), plus clear program cards with “Register” buttons.
4. **Testimonials or community quotes**: Builds trust (especially for families and seniors) by showing positive experiences.
5. **FAQ + policies**: Refund/cancellation, facility rules, accessibility accommodations, and membership details.

## Design Process

- **Empathize & research**: Used your interview insights to identify what each group needs most (students want fast mobile scheduling, families need clearer kids programs and easier multi-child registration, seniors need readability and clear support options).
- **Define**: Turned those insights into problem statements and success criteria (e.g., “A parent should be able to find an age-appropriate program in under a minute” or “A senior should immediately see the phone number/help option”).
- **Ideate**: Brainstormed multiple layout and navigation approaches (Facilities vs Programs vs Schedule) and decide on a structure that reduces clutter and improves findability.
- **UX wireframes in Figma**: Designed low-fidelity wireframes (page layout, content hierarchy, user flows like “find a swim class → register”) and iterate quickly before coding.
- **UI design in Figma**: Designed higher-fidelity mockups (colors, typography, components) and keep screens consistent by using reusable styles/components.
- **Prototype & test**: Designed a clickable Figma prototype to validate key tasks and refine labels, spacing, and flow based on feedback.
- **Development & build**: Implement the approved design using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, focusing on responsive layout, components, and accessibility checks.
- **Iterate after build**: Noted any final fixes from testing on real devices (spacing, readability, navigation, performance).




## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Confusing child program listings for parents.<br/>
**Solution**: Added age filters, “recommended for” labels, and a dedicated kids hub with simple categories.
- **Challenge**: Users distrust schedules that aren’t updated.<br/>
**Solution**: Show “last updated” indicators, add cancellation alerts, and keep schedule views simple and fast on mobile.
- **Challenge**: Mobile optimization for students on-the-go.<br/>
**Solution**: Mobile-first layout, sticky navigation for Programs/Schedule, and short registration steps with clear confirmations.
- **Challenge**: Seniors struggle with small text and busy layouts.<br/>
**Solution**: Larger base font, strong contrast, generous spacing, fewer columns, and a prominent phone/help option on every key page.
